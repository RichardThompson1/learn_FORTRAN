# learn_FORTRAN
learning FORTRAN with CUDA for scientific computing

Overview

This demo program in Fortran demonstrates basic file operations, arithmetic processing, and the use of control structures. It reads integers from a file, performs simple arithmetic operations on them, and writes the results to another file.
Structure


    Arithmetic Operations: Modifies numbers declared locally, as well as in a 1-D and 2-D array
    File I/O: Manages reading from and writing to files.
    Arithmetic Operations: Modifies numbers read from the input file.
    Control Logic: Uses loops and conditionals to manage flow control.
